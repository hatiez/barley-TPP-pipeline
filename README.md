# Prediction of Harvest-Related Traits in Barley Using High-Throughput Phenotyping and Machine Learning

This repository accompanies the project **"Prediction of harvest-related traits in barley using high-throughput phenotyping data and machine learning."**

**[Publication (Coming Soon)](TODO)** — Please refer to the publication for background, methodology, and results.

## Repository Structure

- **`PublData/`**  
  Contains all raw and processed phenotyping and harvest data files required to run the analysis.

- **`Rscripts/`**  
  Includes all analysis scripts and their corresponding function files. These are organized by stage in the pipeline:

  - **Preprocessing**  
    - `preProcessing.R`

  - **Tolerance Ranking**  
    - `ToleranceRanking.R`  
    - `ToleranceRankingFunctions.R`

  - **Variance Decomposition**  
    - `varianceDecomp.R`  
    - `varianceDecompFunctions.R`

  - **Treatment Classification (TPC)**  
    - `TreatmentClassification.R`  
    - `TreatmentClassificationFunctions.R`

  - **Harvest Trait Prediction (TPP)**  
    - `RFHarvestPrediction.R`  
    - `LASSOHarvestPrediction.R`  
    - `RFHarvestPredictionFunctions.R`  
    - `LASSOHarvestPredictionFunctions.R`

  - **Model Evaluation**  
    - `HarvestPredictionEvaluation.R`  
    - `HarvestPredictionEvaluationFunctions.R`

- **`Rout/`**  
  This directory is auto-generated by the scripts to store outputs from the analysis. If not present, it will be created when you run a script.

## Running the Pipeline

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Each script checks for and offers to install any required packages if they're missing.

2. **Run pre-processing first**  
   You must run `preProcessing.R` before using any downstream scripts, as many depend on pre-processed data.

3. **Follow analysis stages**  
   - Run tolerance ranking, variance decomposition, or classification independently.
   - For TPP model evaluation, make sure to first generate the prediction models using the RF and LASSO scripts.

## Model Availability

Due to size constraints, trained machine learning models for TPP and TPC will be hosted externally. A download link will be provided here once uploaded. These models can be used directly for replication or evaluation.

---

## Notes

- All files use consistent naming and directory structure — do not change these unless you modify the scripts accordingly.
